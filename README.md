# ECE383_Lab03

#Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to recreate the oscilloscope made in lab2 using a microblaze controller in place of the finite state machine.  Also, both the triggerVolt and triggerTime will be needed to set the signal on the screen.  

#Planning

For lab 2, the following block diagram was used in planning:
